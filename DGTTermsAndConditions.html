    <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
    <p>It is hoped that should we ever have any differences, we could be able to work them out amicably. However,
        should we
        be unable to seek resolution within a reasonable time, you agree now that that the only method of legal
        dispute
        resolution that will be used is binding arbitration before a single arbitrator, selected jointly, in
        accordance
        with
        the American Arbitration Association Rules. Prior to seeking arbitration, you must send an e-mail to us and
        include
        all of your reasons for dissatisfaction with your Program. You also agree that should arbitration take
        place, it
        will be held in Nebraska, and the prevailing party shall be entitled to all reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees
        and
        all
        costs necessary to enforce the decision of the arbitrator. You further understand and agree now that the
        only
        remedy
        that can be awarded to you through arbitration is full refund of your Payment made to date. No other actions
        or
        financial awards of consequential damages, or any other type of damages, may be granted to you. We both
        agree
        now
        that the decision of the arbitrator is final and binding, and may be entered as a judgment into any court
        having
        the
        appropriate jurisdiction. You also agree that this document shall be construed with the laws of the State of
        Nebraska.</p>
    <p><b>By using or accessing the Information or Website, you are agreeing to a modification of the statute of
            limitations
            such that any arbitration must begin within one (1) year of the date of your e-mail to the Company
            referenced
            above
            or you thereby waive the right to seek dispute resolution by arbitration or to take any other legal
            action.</b></p>
    <p>In the event of a dispute between us, you agree to not engage in any conduct or communications, public or
        private,
        including on social media, designed to disparage the Company, any Company Person, or any of its programs,
        products
        or services. Where requested by law or arbitration, of course, you are not prohibited from sharing your
        thoughts
        and
        opinions as a part of the legal process.</p>
    <p>If any terms of these foregoing arbitration terms are construed to be invalid or unenforceable for any
